% THE ABSTRACT

Motivated by other algorithmic problems, we are aiming to enumerate transformation semigroups on $n$ points by finding all subsemigroups of the full transformation semigroup $T_n$.

Pen and paper calculation shows that there are $10$ subsemigroups of $T_2$ in $8$ conjugacy classes.
Brute force computer calculation (checking all subsets) gives the answer for $n=3$: there are 1299 subsemigroups in 283 conjugacy classes.

Due to the huge search space, for $n=4$,  we have to use a different method.
With some heuristics applied we recursively reduce the multiplication table of the semigroup.
Computations are under way, but we know that there are (at least) 3788252 subsemigroups in 162332 conjugacy classes of $K_{4,2}$, the semigroup of all transformations on 4 points with image size of maximum 2.
Due to the generality of the method, we can enumerate the subsemigroups of an arbitrary transformation semigroup and we can ask special questions like ``What are the semigroups that contain no constant maps?''. This can be used for enumerating automata with no synchronizing words.

In this talk we describe the reduction algorithm and the obtained data sets in more detail.
This is a joint work with {\sc James D. Mitchell} (University of St Andrews) and {\sc James East} (University of Western Sydney).
