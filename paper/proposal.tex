A \emph{transformation} is a function $f:X\rightarrow X$ from a set to itself.
Restricting our atention to finite set, this mathematical object is so basic that we can easily answer all questions about it.
However, the situation changes dramatically when we start combining transformations.
A \emph{transformation semigroup} of degree $n$ is a collection of transformations of an $n$-element set closed under function composition.
How many degree $n$ transformation semigroups are there? Up to conjugacy? Up to isomorphism? What exactly are they?

ENUMERATION problem

Can we represent a particular abstract semigroup as a degree $n$ ts?
