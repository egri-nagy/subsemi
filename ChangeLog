0.13
	Removing equivalent generators is done only once for the minimal closure method.
0.12
	Added possibility to search for minimal generating sets as well. This required the minimal closure search to change to breadth-first. Depth-first is still possible.
0.11
	Reviewing closures. Finetuning logging and dumping in SubSgpsByMinClosures. FullSet, EmptySet now attributes.
0.10
	1Extension renamed to MinClosure.
0.9
	IsClosedSubTable added. SubSgpsBy1ExtensionsParametrized added enabling faster torso combinations. The empty semigroup is returned now as a subsemigroup.
0.8
	IsomorphismMulTabs, IsomorphismSemigroups added.
0.7
	SgpInMulTab can be given different closure functions.
0.6
	Alternative closure method added, further work on combining ideals, simplifications.
0.5
	Lot of work on enumerating by parallel search for ideals.
0.4
	MulTab now is an attribute storing object, so no more record references.
0.3
	Adding invariants for both element and multiplication table level.
0.2
	Adding test cases, checking against brute-force methods. Converting between the indicator set (bitlist) and the subsets of semigroups.
0.1
	Working 1-extension method transferred, but poor package structure, no test cases yet.
