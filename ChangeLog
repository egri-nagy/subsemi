0.26
	Improved semigroup tagging and new memory-efficient filing function.
0.25
	Improving the calculation of isomorphism classes: preclassifying by the number of idempotents.
0.24
	Further tree pruning in SubSgpsByMinExtensions by the normalizer of the subsemigroup (James). Checkpointing added. Several small corrections, commenting.
0.23
	SubSemiTestAll/TestInstall now separated. Symmetric inverse semigroup test added. Unnecessary (used only once) functions removed.
0.22
	Improved filing script.
0.21
	SubSgpsByUpperTorsos is the correct function name.
0.20
	Separating upper torso calculation. It is now possible not to calculate the ideal again (empty upper torso can be removed).
0.19
	BUGFIX: in minextensions.gi, removing the generators already in the baseset caused losses in the torso calculation.
0.18
	IsomorphismSemigroups -> IsomorphismSemigroupsByMulTabs, following upstream changes.
0.17
	NilPotencyDegreeByMulTabs added.
0.16
	IndicatorSetByElements (and similar functions in the gang) can now take multiplication tables as arguments instead of the sorted elements. Just for convenience.
0.15
	Reviewing the isomorphism code. ElementProfileLookup added. Improving Is3NilPotent.
0.14
	Just renaming to follow the paper's terminology: minimal closures to minimal extensions.
0.13
	Removing equivalent generators is done only once for the minimal closure method.
0.12
	Added possibility to search for minimal generating sets as well. This required the minimal closure search to change to breadth-first. Depth-first is still possible.
0.11
	Reviewing closures. Finetuning logging and dumping in SubSgpsByMinClosures. FullSet, EmptySet now attributes.
0.10
	1Extension renamed to MinClosure.
0.9
	IsClosedSubTable added. SubSgpsBy1ExtensionsParametrized added enabling faster torso combinations. The empty semigroup is returned now as a subsemigroup.
0.8
	IsomorphismMulTabs, IsomorphismSemigroups added.
0.7
	SgpInMulTab can be given different closure functions.
0.6
	Alternative closure method added, further work on combining ideals, simplifications.
0.5
	Lot of work on enumerating by parallel search for ideals.
0.4
	MulTab now is an attribute storing object, so no more record references.
0.3
	Adding invariants for both element and multiplication table level.
0.2
	Adding test cases, checking against brute-force methods. Converting between the indicator set (bitlist) and the subsets of semigroups.
0.1
	Working 1-extension method transferred, but poor package structure, no test cases yet.
