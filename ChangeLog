0.5
	Lot of work on enumerating by parallel search for ideals.
0.4
	MulTab now is an attribute storing object, so no more record references.
0.3
	Adding invariants for both element and multiplication table level.
0.2
	Adding test cases, checking against brute-force methods. Converting between the indicator set (bitlist) and the subsets of semigroups.
0.1
	Working 1-extension method transferred, but poor package structure, no test cases yet.
