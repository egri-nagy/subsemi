Recomputing Sub(T4)

Here are some instructions for recalculating the enumeration results of all transformation semigroups of degree 4. Some steps can be done in parallel, so the more cores you have the better.
 

File types:

*.reps - conjugacy class representatives only
*.subs - all subsemigroups

Naming: 

T_S - file contains the subsemigroups of T within the ambient semigroup S
