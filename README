SubSemi

GAP package for enumerating subsemigroups of semigroup, deciding isomorphisms
and constructing embeddings. The algorithms assume that the elements of the
semigroups can be fully calculated, therefore their applicability is limited
to relatively small semigroups.

Indeed, the original motivation for developing the package was the computational
enumeration of transformation semigroups up to degree 4. Instructions for
recomputing those results can be found in the 

data/T4
data/Transformation 

folders. 

The code is highly experimental with no user documentation,
only inline comments. The algorithms are described on a
high level in the paper 'On Enumerating Transformation Semigroups'
